Node app accepting POST requests and sending the data as email.

Most basic node app for that task that you could imagine.

Using [express.js](https://expressjs.com) and [nodemailer](https://nodemailer.com/).

Options set via `.env` file:
```bash
APIKEY=xxx
PORT=3000
MAILPASS=xxx
MAILUSER=my@mail.address
MAILPORT=465
MAILSERVER=smtp.mail.server

```
